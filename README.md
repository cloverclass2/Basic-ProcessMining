# ProcessMining-105

This code lab is for process mining basic algorithm and implementation written in C# languange, and this code is part of another project called pgmpm/ProcessCubeExplorer in Germany. (Link will be on github)

Quick introduction to process mining.

Process Mining extracts implicit knowledge from event logs and generates process models to visualize the underlying process, and for addition this code was built to connect with various databases and load multidimensional event logs in which the characteristics of the process-instance are modeled as dimensions in a data warehouse-like schema.
